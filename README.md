## What is Numpy ?
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. ... These includes how to create NumPy arrays, use broadcasting, access values, and manipulate arrays
#### I work on Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) to make it clear 
How to install numpy ?
pip install numpy
conda install numpy
#### This notebook include all what you need to know about numpy like:
1. Numpy Indexing and Selection
1.1] Indexing
1.2] Conditional Selection

2. Numpy Operations
2.1] Array with array
2.2] Array with Scalars
2.3] Universal array functions

3. Numpy Functionsnp.array(list)  
np.eye(4) 
np.ones((3,4)) 
np.zeros((5,5)) 
np.arange(0,11,2)
np.random.rand(5) 
np.random.randn(2)
np.random.randint()
etc..
